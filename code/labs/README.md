# Labs

## Summary
Labs are where the repo stops being chapter-by-chapter pedagogy and starts telling complete optimization stories.
Some labs are strict baseline/optimized benchmark pairs. Others are playbooks or matrix harnesses that need a different, more honest doc shape.

## How To Read This Directory
There are two useful lab classes in this repo:

- **Benchmark-pair labs**: these expose harness targets, keep correctness gates, and are the right place to make performance claims.
- **Playbook / matrix labs**: these package workflows, scenario drills, or large tuning matrices. They are still valuable, but they should not pretend to be a single baseline/optimized benchmark when they are not.

## What Counts As A Good Lab Here
A strong public lab should make three things obvious:

- what the baseline path is
- what changed in the optimized or alternative path
- what measured artifact proves the claim

If a lab cannot answer those questions yet, the doc should say so directly instead of faking a benchmark pair.

## Learning Goals
- Help readers find the right lab quickly.
- Separate benchmark-pair labs from playbook/matrix labs honestly.
- Point contributors toward the repo's expected lab quality bar.

## Directory Layout
| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `labs/block_scaling`, `labs/blackwell_matmul`, `labs/blackwell_gemm_optimizations`, `labs/flashattention4`, `labs/memory_bandwidth_patterns`, `labs/nccl_nixl_nvshmem`, `labs/persistent_decode`, `labs/parameterized_cuda_graphs`, `labs/training_hotpath` | Benchmark-pair labs with strong kernel/perf narratives and artifact-backed measured deltas, including narrow bandwidth-pattern, communication-stack tradeoff, and CUDA-graph replay labs. |
| `labs/cache_aware_disagg_inference`, `labs/decode_optimization`, `labs/kv_optimization`, `labs/moe_cuda`, `labs/moe_optimization_journey` | Serving-path and MoE labs where the benchmark pair is part of a broader optimization story. |
| `labs/moe_decode_blackwell_matrix`, `labs/nanochat_fullstack`, `labs/python_concurrency`, `labs/vllm-deepseek-tuning` | Larger workflow-oriented and matrix/playbook labs that need a richer doc model than a simple pair benchmark. |
| `labs/nvfp4_*` | Low-precision kernel labs where verification discipline matters as much as the timing win. |

## Running the Benchmarks
Use the benchmark harness for quick comparisons or drive the Typer CLI when you need repeatable artifact capture.
```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter labs/block_scaling
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter labs/decode_optimization
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter labs/memory_bandwidth_patterns
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter labs/nccl_nixl_nvshmem
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter labs/moe_cuda
```
- Use `list-targets` first; the benchmark-pair labs expose clean harness targets, while the playbook/matrix labs often have their own scripts or Makefiles.
- Use `labs/memory_bandwidth_patterns` when you want a narrow coalescing/vectorization/shared-memory bandwidth lab instead of a broader serving-path workflow.
- Use `labs/nccl_nixl_nvshmem` when you want communication-stack tradeoffs and capability probing instead of a broader distributed-training or serving workflow.
- If a lab does not have a clean baseline/optimized target yet, do not invent one in documentation.

## Validation Checklist
- Benchmark-facing labs should expose reproducible harness targets or clearly document why they are still workflow/matrix labs.
- Public lab READMEs should prefer measured artifact-backed claims over generic feature descriptions.

## Notes
- Labs now intentionally support both benchmark-pair docs and honest workflow/component docs. The distinction is part of the quality bar, not an exception to it.
