# Lab - FlashAttention-4 Pipeline Co-Design

## Summary
Recreates the practical shape of the FlashAttention-4 article: eager FlexAttention as the scalar-heavy baseline, then a compiled Blackwell-friendly path that tries the FLASH backend and falls back to FlexAttention+TMA when needed. The default benchmark uses ALiBi because it is stable on the local stack and still exercises the FA4 score-mod path.

## Problem
This lab is here to test two different questions cleanly:
- does the fused FA4-style path beat the eager score-materializing baseline in this repo?
- does the local stack reproduce the Colfax / PyTorch FlashAttention-4 performance envelope?

## Baseline Path
- eager FlexAttention
- explicit score materialization
- good correctness reference, bad steady-state cost model

## Optimized Path
- compiled Blackwell-oriented path
- prefers the experimental FLASH backend
- falls back to compiled FlexAttention + TMA when the backend/toolchain combination cannot lower cleanly

## Measured Delta
Current validated harness result for the default `ALiBi` target from `artifacts/runs/20260306_023114__bench__profile_none_targets_labs_flashattention4_flashattention4_alibi/`:

| Path | Latency | Relative |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Baseline (`baseline_flashattention4`) | `5.562 ms` | `1.00x` |
| Optimized (`optimized_flashattention4_alibi`) | `0.385 ms` | `14.45x faster` |

This lab also carries an important negative result: the local stack does **not** currently reproduce the published Colfax/PyTorch FA4 envelope on the direct TFLOP/s microbench. That is a useful finding, not a documentation problem to hide.

## Profiler Evidence
Use the harness for artifacted Nsight evidence:

```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/flashattention4:flashattention4_alibi --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
```

Use the microbenchmark when you want the closest backend-vs-backend comparison to the published articles:

```bash
python labs/flashattention4/tflops_microbench.py --preset public_blog --mode dense causal alibi
python labs/flashattention4/tflops_microbench.py --preset peak_probe --mode dense causal --backends flash_backend triton_flex cudnn_sdpa
```

## Repro Commands
```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter labs/flashattention4
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/flashattention4:flashattention4_alibi --profile minimal
python labs/flashattention4/tflops_microbench.py --preset public_blog --mode dense causal alibi
```

## Learning Goals
- Measure the delta between eager score materialization and a fused compiled attention kernel.
- Exercise FA4-style score modifiers such as ALiBi and soft-capped logits, and optionally probe sliding-window masks on a best-effort basis.
- Inspect provider selection on Blackwell (`flash_backend` vs `flex_tma`).
- Use a coarse pipeline model to explain why overlap matters more under asymmetric hardware scaling.

## Directory Layout
| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `baseline_flashattention4.py`, `optimized_flashattention4.py` | Benchmark pair comparing eager FlexAttention to a compiled, provider-aware FA4 path. |
| `flashattention4_common.py` | Shared input builders, score mods, mask construction, and provider resolution. |
| `pipeline_model.py` | Latency model for serial versus overlapped attention tiles. |
| `tflops_microbench.py` | Clock-locked TFLOPs/s microbenchmark for Colfax/PyTorch-style backend comparisons. |

## Running the Benchmarks
Use the benchmark harness for quick comparisons or drive the Typer CLI when you need repeatable artifact capture.
```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter labs/flashattention4
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/flashattention4 --profile minimal
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/flashattention4:flashattention4_alibi --profile minimal
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/flashattention4:best_available_attention_dense --profile minimal
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/flashattention4:flashattention4_softcap --profile minimal
python labs/flashattention4/pipeline_model.py --tiles 32 --tensor-core-scale 4 --scalar-scale 2
python labs/flashattention4/tflops_microbench.py --preset public_blog --mode dense causal alibi
python labs/flashattention4/tflops_microbench.py --preset peak_probe --mode dense causal --backends flash_backend triton_flex cudnn_sdpa
```
- Harness workflows use explicit targets such as `flashattention4_dense`, `flashattention4_causal`, `flashattention4_alibi`, `flashattention4_softcap`, `flashattention4_windowed`, `flashattention4_alibi_windowed`, and the matching `best_available_attention_*` variants.
- On the local `torch 2.9.1+cu130` build, `windowed` and `alibi_windowed` are experimental: the optimized path can produce non-finite outputs on a fresh compile even though upstream FA4 supports sliding-window patterns.
- `tflops_microbench.py` locks GPU clocks through `core.harness.benchmark_harness.lock_gpu_clocks()` by default; use `--no-lock-gpu-clocks` only for local debugging.

## Validation Checklist
- `python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/flashattention4 --profile minimal` shows the eager baseline materializing scores while the optimized path stays fused.
- `python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/flashattention4:flashattention4_alibi --profile minimal` succeeds on a cold-start process and exercises the FA4 score-mod path without relying on env vars.
- `python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/flashattention4:best_available_attention_dense --profile minimal` gives the clearest absolute-performance path for standard attention on this stack.
- `python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/flashattention4:flashattention4_windowed --profile minimal` and `labs/flashattention4:flashattention4_alibi_windowed` remain explicit experimental probes; treat failures there as a PyTorch/FA4 integration limitation on this stack rather than as a lab bug.
- `python labs/flashattention4/pipeline_model.py --tiles 64 --tensor-core-scale 4 --scalar-scale 2` demonstrates overlap becoming more valuable as tensor cores scale faster than scalar hardware.
- `python labs/flashattention4/tflops_microbench.py --preset public_blog --mode dense causal alibi` runs the public-shape backend comparison against the local FLASH backend, the local Triton-style proxy, and cuDNN where supported.
- `python labs/flashattention4/tflops_microbench.py --preset peak_probe --mode dense causal --backends flash_backend triton_flex cudnn_sdpa` checks whether a larger compute-bound shape moves the local stack toward the published Colfax/PyTorch envelope.

## TFLOPs/s Microbenchmark
Use `tflops_microbench.py` when you want something closer to the published Colfax and PyTorch comparisons than the harness benchmark pair. The harness pair is intentionally end-to-end and compares eager score materialization against a fused kernel; the microbenchmark instead compares backend implementations on the same attention workload.

| Published comparison target | Local command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Colfax B200 BF16 forward envelope (`1605 TFLOPs/s`, up to `1.3x` over cuDNN 9.13, up to `2.7x` over Triton) | `python labs/flashattention4/tflops_microbench.py --preset peak_probe --mode dense causal --backends flash_backend triton_flex cudnn_sdpa` | Uses a larger shape to push the local stack harder. |
| PyTorch GB200 standard-attention forward envelope (`1.6x-3.2x` over Triton) | `python labs/flashattention4/tflops_microbench.py --preset public_blog --mode dense causal` | Uses the public blog shape `B=2, H=8, S=2048, D=128`. |
| PyTorch GB200 ALiBi forward envelope (`1.2x-2.1x` over Triton) | `python labs/flashattention4/tflops_microbench.py --preset public_blog --mode alibi --backends flash_backend triton_flex flex_tma` | cuDNN SDPA is not applicable to ALiBi. |

The FLOP accounting matches the common SDPA forward convention used in vendor/blog comparisons:
`forward_flops = 4 * batch * heads * head_dim * nonmasked_attention_elements`

- For `dense`, `alibi`, and `softcap`, `nonmasked_attention_elements = q_seq_len * kv_seq_len`.
- For `causal`, `windowed`, and `alibi_windowed`, only the unmasked score matrix entries are counted.
- `triton_flex` is the closest local proxy for the blog's Triton baseline: compiled FlexAttention with `USE_TMA=False`.

## Current Local Results
These measurements were taken on March 5, 2026 on the current local `torch 2.9.1+cu130` stack with harness clock locking enabled. This host is still virtualized, so treat the numbers as directional rather than canonical.

### Public Blog Shape (`B=2, H=8, S=2048, D=128`)
| Mode | Backend | Median (ms) | TFLOPs/s | Flash vs Triton | Flash vs cuDNN | Published check |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `dense` | `flash_backend` | 0.224 | 153.6 | `1.02x` | `0.40x` | Outside Colfax and PyTorch ranges |
| `dense` | `triton_flex` | 0.229 | 150.1 | `1.00x` | `0.39x` | Local Triton-style proxy |
| `dense` | `cudnn_sdpa` | 0.090 | 382.5 | `2.55x` | `1.00x` | Local cuDNN leader |
| `causal` | `flash_backend` | 0.238 | 72.1 | `14.84x` | `0.37x` | Beats local Triton-style proxy, still far below cuDNN |
| `causal` | `triton_flex` | 3.538 | 4.9 | `1.00x` | `0.02x` | Local Triton-style proxy collapses on this stack |
| `causal` | `cudnn_sdpa` | 0.088 | 195.5 | `40.25x` | `1.00x` | Local cuDNN leader |
| `alibi` | `flash_backend` | 6.221 | 5.5 | `1.02x` | n/a | Outside PyTorch ALiBi range |
| `alibi` | `triton_flex` | 6.323 | 5.4 | `1.00x` | n/a | Local Triton-style proxy |
| `alibi` | `flex_tma` | 6.169 | 5.6 | `1.03x` | n/a | Slightly ahead locally, still not near published envelope |

### Peak Probe Shape (`B=8, H=16, S=4096, D=128`)
| Mode | Backend | Median (ms) | TFLOPs/s | % of Colfax 1605 | Flash vs Triton | Flash vs cuDNN |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `dense` | `flash_backend` | 3.576 | 307.5 | 19.2% | `1.01x` | `0.34x` |
| `dense` | `triton_flex` | 3.614 | 304.2 | 19.0% | `1.00x` | `0.34x` |
| `dense` | `cudnn_sdpa` | 1.222 | 899.8 | 56.1% | `2.96x` | `1.00x` |
| `causal` | `flash_backend` | 2.264 | 242.9 | 15.1% | `0.97x` | `0.36x` |
| `causal` | `triton_flex` | 2.200 | 250.0 | 15.6% | `1.00x` | `0.37x` |
| `causal` | `cudnn_sdpa` | 0.814 | 675.1 | 42.1% | `2.70x` | `1.00x` |

The local conclusion is straightforward: this stack does not currently reproduce the published Colfax or PyTorch FlashAttention-4 envelope. The larger probe rules out a pure small-shape saturation explanation because the local FLASH path still tops out at `307.5 TFLOPs/s` on dense and `242.9 TFLOPs/s` on causal, well below both Colfax's `1605 TFLOPs/s` peak and the local cuDNN path.

- For a smaller, schedule-first explanation surface, see `labs/software_pipelining`, which models same-iteration, loop-carried, and anti-dependency constraints without requiring a full FA4 kernel.
- Colfax reports up to `1605 TFLOPs/s` on B200 BF16 at roughly `71%` utilization, plus up to `1.3x` over cuDNN 9.13 and `2.7x` over Triton for forward passes.
- The PyTorch post reports `1.6x-3.2x` forward speedup over Triton for standard dense/causal attention on GB200, `1.2x-2.1x` for ALiBi, and `1.4x-2.1x` for sliding-window attention.
- The local PyTorch/Triton stack needs a quoted backend literal for the experimental FLASH backend; the lab handles that workaround internally and falls back automatically if needed.
- The lab pins float32 accumulation to IEEE mode because the current sm_100 lowering produced non-finite outputs under TF32 accumulation.
- Sliding-window modes remain exposed as explicit benchmark targets, but the stable day-to-day harness path is `flashattention4_alibi`.
