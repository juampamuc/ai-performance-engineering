# Lab - Decode Optimization

## Summary
Decode-focused microbenchmarks that isolate serving-side wins such as pinned memory, streams, compile/graphs, FP8/FP4, warp specialization, and HuggingFace cache policy changes without dragging full attention stacks into every comparison.

## Problem
Decode paths die by a thousand cuts: host staging, stream orchestration, cache policy, compile overhead, and kernel schedule all matter. This lab keeps those costs as separate targets so you can see what actually moves TTFT, TPOT, and total decode latency.

## Baseline Path
- eager decode on pageable inputs and conservative cache policy
- straightforward correctness reference
- enough host and launch overhead to make serving optimizations visible

## Optimized Path
- pinned inputs and dual-stream decode variants
- `torch.compile` and CUDA Graph decode paths
- FP8/FP4 and warp-specialized kernels where the hardware supports them
- static-cache HuggingFace loop for the cache-policy pair

## Measured Delta
Representative strict result from `artifacts/runs/20260302_full_strict_chapter_lab_singlegpu_v2/`:

| Target | Baseline | Optimized | Measured delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `decode` | `9.845 ms` | `2.441 ms` (`ultimate`) | `4.03x` |
| `decode_hf_cache` | `288.157 ms` | `39.843 ms` | `7.23x` |
| `decode_streams` | `27.391 ms` | `23.753 ms` | `1.15x` |
| `decode_warp_specialized` | `38.386 ms` | `14.963 ms` | `2.57x` |
| `decode_double_buffer_tma` | `0.173 ms` | `0.081 ms` | `2.14x` |

This is the useful shape of the lab: some decode optimizations are huge, some are modest, and the lab keeps them separated instead of averaging them into a fake single story.

## Profiler Evidence
```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/decode_optimization:decode --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/decode_optimization:decode_hf_cache --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/decode_optimization:decode_warp_specialized --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
```

Those three targets cover the most useful slices: general decode orchestration, real decoder-loop cache policy, and the fused Triton kernel path.

## Repro Commands
```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter labs/decode_optimization
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/decode_optimization --profile none
python -m cli.aisp demos labs-decode-multigpu --nproc-per-node 4 -- --iters 4 --warmup 1
```

## Learning Goals
- Contrast eager vs pinned/streamed vs compiled/graph decode paths on the same workload.
- Measure FP8/FP4 tensor-core benefits relative to FP16/BF16 baselines.
- Validate Triton warp-specialized decode kernels against Python math and harness expectations.
- Observe NVLink-C2C behavior by scaling the decode loop across available GPUs.

## Running the Benchmarks
Use the benchmark harness for quick comparisons or drive the Typer CLI when you need repeatable artifact capture.
```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter labs/decode_optimization
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/decode_optimization --profile minimal
```
- Targets follow the `labs/decode_optimization:<workload>` naming convention listed by `list-targets`.
- Use `--target-extra-arg labs/decode_optimization:<workload>="--flag value"` to sweep schedule knobs.
- Benchmark validity profile defaults to strict. Virtualization is warning-only; use `--validity-profile portable` for broader compatibility on hardware-limited environments.
- Portable runs do not write expectation files unless `--allow-portable-expectations-update` is also provided.

## Validation Checklist
- Baseline vs pinned/streams shows improved TTFT and TPOT with lower host wait time.
- Compile/graph variants emit fewer kernels and higher tokens/sec than the baseline in harness output.
- FP8/FP4 runs use a prefill-focused workload (`decode_tokens=0`) to surface tensor-core benefits; outputs remain within tolerance.
- Warp-specialized Triton kernel is validated against a workload-matched eager baseline; the expectation file stays green.
- The multi-GPU demo exercises NVLink-C2C without graph-capture failures when launched via `torchrun`.

## Notes
- All targets emit TTFT, TPOT mean, decode time, total time, and tokens/sec in `custom_metrics` for easy diffing.
- FP4 requires NVFP4-capable Blackwell hardware; unsupported platforms fail fast.
- The HF cache pair reproduces the main idea from Chaim Rand's token-generation optimization write-up while keeping the harness contract intact.
