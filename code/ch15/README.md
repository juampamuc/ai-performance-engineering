# Chapter 15 - Disaggregated Inference & KV Management

## Summary
Addresses large-scale inference concerns: disaggregated compute/storage, KV-cache pooling over NVLink, continuous batching, and mixture-of-experts serving patterns. The repo chapter captures the disaggregated serving and KV-management themes directly, while the NIXL-specific connector story from the manuscript is only represented indirectly.

## Problem
Chapter 15 is where inference-system ideas have to justify themselves with end-to-end measurements. The useful question is not "can we disaggregate or batch this?" but "which orchestration changes actually reduce latency or increase throughput once KV movement and scheduling overhead are included?"

## Baseline Path
- monolithic or minimally coordinated inference execution
- straightforward KV management and queue draining
- easy to reason about, but expensive once prefill/decode and cache movement start to dominate

## Optimized Path
- disaggregated prefill/decode and batched scheduling where they help
- NVLink-pooled KV-cache strategies and topology-aware routing
- still measured through the shared benchmark harness, so the chapter is a performance case study instead of a pile of demos

## Measured Delta
Representative validated results from `artifacts/runs/20260303_163946__bench__profile_minimal_targets_20/`:

| Target | Baseline | Optimized | Measured delta | What changed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `continuous_batching` | `52.955 ms` | `12.719 ms` | `4.16x` | queueing and batching strategy |
| `kv_cache_nvlink_pool` | `1047.860 ms` | `171.477 ms` | `6.11x` | pooled KV-cache path |
| `guided_decoding` | `12.702 ms` | `2.131 ms` | `5.96x` | guided decode path |
| `speculative_decoding` | `103.323 ms` | `26.761 ms` | `3.86x` | speculative decode orchestration |

The chapter mixes system-level wins from queueing/orchestration with fabric/cache-path wins. Those are both valuable, but they are not the same optimization story.

## Profiler Evidence
Use deep-dive harness runs when you want to attribute the gains to scheduling, cache movement, or decode behavior instead of only quoting the runtime delta:

```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch15:continuous_batching --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch15:kv_cache_nvlink_pool --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch15:speculative_decoding --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
```

Those runs are the right place to check whether the win came from less queue idle time, less cache movement, or fewer wasted decode steps.

## Repro Commands
```bash
python -m ch15.compare
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter ch15
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch15 --profile minimal
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch15:kv_cache_nvlink_pool --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
```

## Learning Goals
- Benchmark monolithic vs disaggregated inference paths and quantify fabric costs.
- Design KV-cache managers that gracefully span local and remote HBM pools.
- Implement continuous batching and queueing so decode throughput stays high.
- Serve MoE models efficiently by pairing routing with optimized communication.

## Running the Benchmarks
Use the benchmark harness for quick comparisons or drive the Typer CLI when you need repeatable artifact capture.
```bash
python -m ch15.compare
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter ch15
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch15 --profile minimal
```
- Override `--profile` or `--iterations` per workload when capturing Nsight traces.
- Benchmark validity profile defaults to strict. Virtualization is warning-only; use `--validity-profile portable` for broader compatibility on hardware-limited environments.
- Expectation baselines live next to each chapter in `expectations_{hardware_key}.json`; refresh with `--update-expectations` after validating new hardware. In portable mode, add `--allow-portable-expectations-update` to write expectation files explicitly.

## Validation Checklist
- `python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch15:disaggregated_inference_multigpu --profile minimal --ncu-replay-mode kernel` shows reduced fabric stalls compared to the baseline while maintaining accuracy parity (kernel replay avoids NCU application-replay stalls on this workload).
- `python optimized_kv_cache_management.py --validate` confirms eviction + promotion policies keep decode latency within the budget.
- `python compare.py --examples continuous_batching` (single GPU) and `python compare.py --examples continuous_batching_multigpu` (multi-GPU) show optimized scheduling increases tokens/sec vs naive queue draining.

## Notes
- `disaggregated_inference_multigpu.py` can run purely in simulation mode; set `--simulate-network` when hardware isn't wired for NVLink pooling.
- Use `torchrun --nproc_per_node <num_gpus>` to run the disaggregated pipeline on the desired GPU count (defaults to all visible GPUs, even count).
- `Makefile` wraps the MPI/UCX targets needed for the multi-node decode experiments.
