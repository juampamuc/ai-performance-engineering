# Chapter 2 - GPU Hardware Architecture

## Summary
Provides architecture awareness tooling for Blackwell-era systems-query SM and memory specs, validate NVLink throughput, and experiment with CPU-GPU coherency so optimizations stay grounded in measured hardware limits.

## Problem
Chapter 2 is the "know the machine first" chapter. The point is not to collect pretty hardware facts; it is to tie optimization decisions to measured fabric, memory, and coherency behavior on the actual target system.

## Baseline Path
- generic transfer paths that do not exploit topology or coherency
- untuned cuBLAS defaults
- hardware assumptions based on specs instead of measured bandwidth/latency

## Optimized Path
- topology-aware transfer and coherency choices
- tuned cuBLAS invocation parameters
- system bring-up driven by measured bandwidth ceilings rather than marketing numbers

## Measured Delta
Representative validated results from `artifacts/runs/20260303_163946__bench__profile_minimal_targets_20/`:

| Target | Baseline | Optimized | Measured delta | What changed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `grace_coherent_memory` | `22468.299 ms` | `970.890 ms` | `23.14x` | coherent-memory placement stops fighting the platform |
| `memory_transfer` | `18.901 ms` | `3.637 ms` | `5.20x` | optimized transfer path fits the actual link behavior |
| `cublas` | `0.590 ms` | `0.114 ms` | `5.17x` | tuned cuBLAS settings match the hardware better |

`grace_coherent_memory` is only valid on Grace-Blackwell coherent-memory hosts. On PCIe-only Blackwell or other non-Grace systems, the target fails fast with `SKIPPED:` instead of emitting fallback transfer numbers under the wrong benchmark name.

This chapter is the hardware sanity anchor for later claims: if these numbers drift, everything that depends on them deserves scrutiny.

## Profiler Evidence
These are mostly hardware-path benchmarks, so the main evidence is topology, transfer, and kernel traces rather than high-level model metrics:

```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch02:cublas --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch02:memory_transfer --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch02:grace_coherent_memory --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
```

The expected story is:
- `cublas`: better math-mode and launch configuration behavior
- `memory_transfer`: less time lost to the wrong host/device path
- `grace_coherent_memory`: on GB200/GB300 the placement choice dominates runtime; on non-Grace hosts the benchmark should fail fast with `SKIPPED:`

## Repro Commands
```bash
python -m ch02.compare
python -m ch02.hardware_info
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter ch02
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch02 --profile minimal
```

## Learning Goals
- Query and log GPU, CPU, and fabric capabilities before running performance studies.
- Measure NVLink, PCIe, and memory-bandwidth ceilings using purpose-built microbenchmarks.
- Validate Grace-Blackwell coherency paths to know when zero-copy buffers help or hurt.
- Contrast baseline vs optimized cuBLAS invocations to highlight architecture-specific tuning levers.

## Directory Layout
| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `hardware_info.py`, `cpu_gpu_topology_aware.py` | System scanners that record GPU capabilities, NUMA layout, NVLink/NVSwitch connectivity, and affinity hints. |
| `nvlink_c2c_bandwidth_benchmark.py`, `baseline_memory_transfer.py`, `optimized_memory_transfer.py`, `memory_transfer_pcie_demo.cu`, `memory_transfer_nvlink_demo.cu`, `memory_transfer_zero_copy_demo.cu`, `baseline_memory_transfer_multigpu.cu`, `optimized_memory_transfer_multigpu.cu` | Peer-to-peer and zero-copy experiments for quantifying NVLink, PCIe, and coherent memory performance. |
| `cpu_gpu_grace_blackwell_coherency.cu`, `cpu_gpu_grace_blackwell_coherency_sm121` | Grace-Blackwell cache-coherent samples that compare explicit transfers vs shared mappings. |
| `baseline_cublas.py`, `optimized_cublas.py` | cuBLAS GEMM benchmark pair that toggles TF32, tensor op math, and stream affinity to highlight architecture knobs. |
| `compare.py`, `Makefile`, `expectations_{hardware_key}.json` | Harness driver, CUDA build rules, and expectation file for automated pass/fail checks. |

## Running the Benchmarks
Use the benchmark harness for quick comparisons or drive the Typer CLI when you need repeatable artifact capture.
```bash
python -m ch02.compare
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter ch02
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch02 --profile minimal
```
- Override `--profile` or `--iterations` per workload when capturing Nsight traces.
- Benchmark validity profile defaults to strict. Virtualization is warning-only; use `--validity-profile portable` for broader compatibility on hardware-limited environments.
- Expectation baselines live next to each chapter in `expectations_{hardware_key}.json`; refresh with `--update-expectations` after validating new hardware. In portable mode, add `--allow-portable-expectations-update` to write expectation files explicitly.

## Validation Checklist
- `python -m ch02.hardware_info` records the correct device name, SM count, and HBM size for every GPU in the system.
- `python -m ch02.nvlink_c2c_bandwidth_benchmark` reports the host↔device and bidirectional bandwidth table for the active topology.
- Running the coherency sample on GB200/GB300 shows zero-copy benefiting sub-MB transfers while large transfers favor explicit H2D copies; on non-Grace hosts the benchmark should stop immediately with a `SKIPPED:` capability diagnostic.

## Notes
- Grace-only coherency tests require GB200/GB300 nodes; on PCIe-only or discrete-GPU Blackwell hosts the Python benchmark pair fails fast with an explicit unsupported-capability diagnostic.
- `Makefile` builds both CUDA and CPU tools so results can be compared without leaving the chapter.
