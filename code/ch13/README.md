# Chapter 13 - PyTorch Profiling & Memory Tuning

## Summary
Focuses on PyTorch-centric optimizations: compiled autograd, memory profiling, FSDP/context/expert parallelism, and FP8/quantization workflows backed by the same harness infrastructure. The chapter README is fairness-refreshed so canonical pairs stay separate from informational variants such as `torchao_quantization_compiled` and `kv_cache_naive_flash_blockwise`.

## Problem
Chapter 13 is where high-level PyTorch optimizations have to prove they are doing more than rearranging framework overhead. The useful question is not "can PyTorch do this optimization?" but "which profiling, compilation, precision, and memory changes actually improve the workload under the shared harness?"

## Baseline Path
- eager or less-optimized PyTorch execution
- higher-overhead cache, precision, and dataloader paths
- easier to debug, but often too expensive once memory and framework overhead dominate

## Optimized Path
- compiled, quantized, or allocator-aware PyTorch paths where they produce a real measured benefit
- lower-overhead cache and attention paths
- still benchmarked through the same harness contract, so the numbers stay comparable to the lower-level chapters

## Measured Delta
Representative validated results from `artifacts/runs/20260303_163946__bench__profile_minimal_targets_20/`:

| Target | Baseline | Optimized | Measured delta | What changed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `kv_cache_naive` | `1664.672 ms / 1194.135 MB` | `1739.080 ms / 370.394 MB` | `68.98% less memory` | token-by-token paged allocation preserves the batch contract while cutting KV-cache footprint |
| `autograd_standard` | `1.644 ms` | `0.204 ms` | `8.04x` | compiled/optimized autograd path |
| `precisionfp8_te` | `2.800 ms` | `0.542 ms` | `5.17x` | Transformer Engine FP8 path |

This chapter is one of the easiest places to fool yourself with framework overhead. That is why the benchmark contract and side-by-side baseline/optimized structure matter here more than almost anywhere else.

## Profiler Evidence
Use deep-dive runs when you want to see whether the gain came from framework overhead reduction, memory behavior, or the lower-precision path itself:

```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch13:kv_cache_naive --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch13:autograd_standard --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch13:precisionfp8_te --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
```

Those targets cover three different PyTorch optimization stories:
- `kv_cache_naive`: cache-path and memory behavior, with memory reduction treated as the primary win
- `autograd_standard`: framework/compile overhead
- `precisionfp8_te`: lower-precision execution with real library support

## Repro Commands
```bash
python -m ch13.compare
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter ch13
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch13 --profile minimal
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch13:precisionfp8_te --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
```

## Learning Goals
- Profile PyTorch training loops end-to-end, capturing goodput, memory, and kernel traces.
- Apply `torch.compile`, regional compilation, and custom allocators to reduce overhead.
- Tune DataLoader, KV-cache, and optimizer states to eliminate fragmentation.
- Exercise FP8/quantized training recipes with Transformer Engine integration.

## Running the Benchmarks
Use the benchmark harness for quick comparisons or drive the Typer CLI when you need repeatable artifact capture.
```bash
python -m ch13.compare
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter ch13
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch13 --profile minimal
```
- Override `--profile` or `--iterations` per workload when capturing Nsight traces.
- Benchmark validity profile defaults to strict. Virtualization is warning-only; use `--validity-profile portable` for broader compatibility on hardware-limited environments.
- Expectation baselines live next to each chapter in `expectations_{hardware_key}.json`; refresh with `--update-expectations` after validating new hardware. In portable mode, add `--allow-portable-expectations-update` to write expectation files explicitly.

## Validation Checklist
- `python -m ch13.compare --examples training_standard` shows optimized training runs producing higher goodput with identical metrics.
- `python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch13:precisionfp8_te --profile minimal` confirms Transformer Engine calibration plus NVFP8 execution with max error tolerances enforced.
- `python -m ch13.memory_profiling --dump` and the optimized variant demonstrate allocator fragmentation dropping after applying the recommended knobs.

## Notes
- `custom_allocator.py` contains a standalone torch allocator shim that can be re-used in other chapters when debugging fragmentation.
- `compiled_autograd.py` doubles as a tutorial on partial graph capture; the README here references it directly.
- `torchao_quantization_compiled` and `kv_cache_naive_flash_blockwise` remain informational variants; `kv_cache_naive` stays canonical, but now as a memory-goal benchmark instead of a speed-goal benchmark.
