## Required Issue Ledger
| Required issue (verbatim) | Status in localhost package | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing node2 fio artifact in canonical package (node2_fio.json absent). | Not applicable (single-node scope) | [published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_localhost_fio.json](published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_localhost_fio.json) |
| No multinode vLLM artifact in canonical package. | Not applicable (single-node scope) | [published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_localhost_vllm_serve_sweep.csv](published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_localhost_vllm_serve_sweep.csv) |
| No nvbandwidth bundle in canonical package. | Not applicable unless explicitly enabled in localhost package | [published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_suite_steps.json](published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_suite_steps.json) |
| Health suite had GDR requested, but effective GDR was false due non-CUDA IB local checks. | Not applicable (`health-suite off`) | [published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_suite_steps.json](published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_suite_steps.json) |
| Tail latency knee is severe at high concurrency (throughput up, TTFT/p99 TTFT much worse). | Not observed in localhost canary sweep by default | [published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_localhost_vllm_serve_sweep.csv](published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_localhost_vllm_serve_sweep.csv) |

## Root Cause + Fix Mapping
| Issue | Root cause | Fix | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| preflight false negatives | pipeline-based service probing could be flaky under strict shell behavior | switch to deterministic `systemctl show -p LoadState` checks | clean preflight in canonical suite steps |
| NVLink topology parse fragility | header parsing assumptions were too strict | parser robustness for single-GPU/non-tab layouts | topology summary + figure generated in canonical package |
| quick-friction red-state noise on localhost | optional external tools may be absent by design | expected-failure classification (`expected_failed_checks` vs `unexpected_failed_checks`) | operator checks are either evidenced directly or marked as skipped in this preset |
