## Benchmark A (Networking Story)
| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| NCCL single-node peak algbw | `2263.5 GB/s` |
| Peak message size | `67108864` bytes |
| Connectivity probe payload algbw | `84.867 GB/s` |
| Connectivity barrier mean | `0.0717 ms` |

Interpretation: single-node communication path is healthy; rank-1 `busbw` should not be interpreted as fabric bottleneck evidence.

## Benchmark B (Inference Story)
| Concurrency | Total tok/s | Mean TTFT (ms) | p99 TTFT (ms) | p99 TPOT (ms) |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `1` | `484.494` | `27.001` | `77.573` | `5.706` |

Interpretation: this is a canary/sparse sweep (<3 concurrency points); use for smoke directionality, not full knee modeling.

## Root Cause + Fix Mapping
| Issue | Root cause | Fix | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `preflight_services` false negatives | pipeline-based unit detection could produce flaky non-zero under strict shell options | use `systemctl show -p LoadState` for deterministic service presence checks | clean preflight status in [published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_preflight_services.json](published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_preflight_services.json) and step rc=0 in [published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_suite_steps.json](published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_suite_steps.json) |
| NVLink parser robustness | topology parser assumptions missed some single-GPU header patterns | robust tokenization and header parsing | topology summary/figure generated: [published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_localhost_meta_nvlink_topology.json](published/current/structured/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_localhost_meta_nvlink_topology.json) and [published/current/figures/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_localhost_meta_nvlink_topology.png](published/current/figures/2026-03-17_localhost_fabric_canonical_localhost_meta_nvlink_topology.png) |

## Report Completeness Delta (vs prior condensed revision)
| Area | Prior state | Current state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package type | environment-focused localhost output possible | full template-style localhost field report package rendered from artifacts |
| Drift risk | hand-updated markdown could diverge from metrics | report is generated directly from structured artifacts for this RUN_ID |
| Operator checks | could appear as degraded without expected-failure context | expected vs unexpected failure classification is explicit in artifacts |
| Cleanup hygiene | superseded localhost runs could remain unless manually deleted | cleanup script supports canonical-run retention and stale artifact pruning |

## Gaps, Risks, and Smell Checks
| Severity | Check | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Medium | quick friction optional tooling | status `ok` with expected failures `none` and unexpected failures `none` |
| Medium | control-plane observability on non-K8s localhost | monitoring control_plane status `not_requested` |
| Medium | single-node-only networking conclusions | scope constrained; no multi-node claims in this package |
| Low | report/template synchronization drift | mitigated via generated localhost report package and validator gate |

## Implications for Small AI Teams
| Area | Practical implication |
| --- | --- |
| Bring-up confidence | strict preflight + required reliability gates provide fast localhost readiness proof before larger spend |
| Operator readiness | quick-friction explicitly separates expected local misses from unexpected blockers |
| Repro speed | full localhost package can be regenerated in one suite run with report renderer integration |

## Stakeholder Recommendations (Prioritized)
| Priority | Recommendation | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Keep strict preflight + required artifact validation as hard gates | avoids false-green benchmark evidence |
| P1 | Keep localhost report generation automated in suite flow | prevents template drift and missing sections |
| P2 | Standardize optional operator tools (`uv`, `whois`, `speedtest`) where required | removes expected-failure noise when those checks are mission-critical |
| P2 | Run cleanup script with canonical-run retention after each new package | keeps artifact corpus unambiguous for stakeholders |
