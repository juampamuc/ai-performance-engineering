# Spectrum-X / RoCE Track

## What This Track Answers

Use this track when the operator question is: "Is the Ethernet/RDMA fabric configured the way an AI workload expects, and does runtime behavior agree with that configuration?"

This track is organized around two answers:

- is the fabric ready from a RoCE, adaptive-routing, and route-health perspective?
- do multi-node AI runtime artifacts agree with the switch-side evidence?

## Scenario: Fabric Readiness

Start here before treating a slow NCCL or all-to-all run as an application problem.

Host-side hints:

- `ethtool`
- `ibstat`
- `rdma link`
- `ibv_devinfo`

Switch-side checks:

- `nv show router adaptive-routing`
- `nv show qos roce`
- `nv show vrf default router bgp neighbor`
- `vtysh -c "show bgp ipv4 unicast summary"`
- `vtysh -c "show ip route vrf default bgp"`

What to record:

- whether high-speed Ethernet is visible from the host
- whether RDMA-over-Ethernet signals are present
- whether RoCE QoS is visible on the switches
- whether adaptive routing is configured
- whether BGP neighbor state and route visibility are available

Interpretation:

- RoCE QoS plus adaptive routing plus BGP visibility forms the minimum publish-grade readiness story.
- Healthy runtime with missing switch access is still only `runtime_verified`, not `full_stack_verified`.
- Route visibility problems should be treated as control-plane degradation even if the workload still moves packets.

## Scenario: Runtime Correlation For AI Workloads

This repo correlates Spectrum-X readiness with the same workload artifacts used everywhere else:

- `<run_id>_2nodes_nccl.json`
- `<run_id>_2nodes_alltoall_nccl_alltoall.json`
- `<run_id>_torchrun_connectivity_probe.json`
- optionally train-step, vLLM, and fio artifacts when those are part of the run

What to look for:

- multi-node NCCL algbw vs single-node NCCL algbw
- all-to-all behavior for exchange-heavy patterns
- world-size and payload success from torchrun connectivity
- whether train-step or vLLM latency knees line up with route/QoS/adaptive-routing evidence

Interpretation rules:

- low multi-node NCCL / single-node NCCL ratio: inspect RoCE QoS, adaptive routing, BGP route visibility, and host RDMA binding
- healthy connectivity probe but weak multi-node throughput: the path exists, but congestion handling or route health still needs work
- healthy switch evidence plus weak application throughput: shift suspicion toward launch shape, queue depths, or model/runtime choices

## Required Management Inputs

Pass these when you want publish-grade Spectrum-X / Cumulus verification:

- `--cumulus-hosts <host1,host2>`
- optionally `--cumulus-user <user>`
- optionally `--cumulus-ssh-key <path>`

If switch access is missing, the repo must report that explicitly. It must not silently claim congestion-feature coverage.

## Typical Failure Shapes

- high-speed Ethernet detected but no switch access: runtime may be green while congestion features remain unverified
- BGP or adaptive-routing checks failing: treat as control-plane degradation, not as a soft warning
- weak multi-node NCCL/all-to-all with Spectrum-X present: correlate QoS, route state, and adaptive-routing evidence before tuning workloads
- healthy control plane plus weak AI workloads: move attention toward host binding, queueing, or application-level contention
