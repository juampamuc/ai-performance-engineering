| Rule | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Artifact paths | Prefer `results/structured/` and `docs/figures/`; link `results/raw/` only when raw logs are required to prove a root-cause claim. |
| Benchmark validity | GPU benchmark runs are valid only if clock locking succeeded; include clock-lock artifacts. |
| Stakeholder handoff | Include repo URL, commit/tag, and collaborator invite/access status. |
| Visual formatting | Show full-size inline images under each subsection; link each image to itself. |
| Evidence formatting | Put `Evidence data:` immediately below visuals, one link per line (`<br/>`), no comma-chained lists. |
| Table preference | Use tables for all high-value sections; narrative is additive and should not replace tables. |
| Chart quality gate | Any curve chart should have at least 3 unique x-values; if fewer, label as `canary/sparse` and state why. |
| Required-gate smoke evidence | Include one post-change smoke run proving semantic `ok` for `hang_triage_bundle`, `torchrun_connectivity_probe`, and `nccl_env_sensitivity` (with artifacts + env-sensitivity visual). |
| Required operator checks evidence | Include `quick_friction` and `monitoring_expectations` artifacts for every in-scope host and summarize degraded/missing-tool diagnostics explicitly. Note: `monitoring_expectations` `control_plane` may be `not_applicable` when Kubernetes is not detected/configured; use `--k8s-mode expect` to require K8s control-plane evidence. |

## Section Retention Gate (CRITICAL)
| Gate | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Mandatory sections | Do not remove or collapse required sections. Keep all ToC entries listed in this template. |
| Weird/normal structure | Keep a single merged section `Weird / New / Interesting (with Normal Baseline)` with both subsections: `Baseline vs Weird Log` and `Deep-Dive Findings`. |
| Required issue ledger | Include the `Required Issues (Explicit)` section with the 5 required issue lines verbatim, each with current status + evidence links. |
| Operator checks retention | Keep `Operator Friction + Monitoring Expectations (Required)` as a standalone section and include node-level structured artifacts + raw logs. |
| Report parity | Include `Report Completeness Delta` section comparing prior report revision vs current report so section/visual loss is visible. |
| Risk transparency | Include `Gaps, Risks, and Smell Checks` even when suite is green. |
| Cleanup disclosure | Include `Canonical Cleanup + Artifact Hygiene` showing what superseded artifacts were removed and what canonical set was preserved. |
| Synchronization | `field-report.md` and `field-report-notes.md` must use the same canonical RUN_ID and issue status framing. |
| Pre-ship section check | Run: `rg -n '^## ' cluster/field-report.md` and verify every mandatory header is present before sign-off. |
| Pre-ship requirements check | Run: `cluster/scripts/validate_field_report_requirements.sh --report cluster/field-report.md --notes cluster/field-report-notes.md` and fail on any missing section/requirement. |

## Case Study Contract (CRITICAL)
| Prompt requirement | Required report coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Tell us a story about this cluster | `Cluster Story (First Contact)` with timeline table + interpretation. |
| What is weird, new, or interesting | One merged section: `Weird / New / Interesting (with Normal Baseline)` with two subsections (`Baseline vs Weird Log`, `Deep-Dive Findings`). |
| Use 1-2 relevant benchmarks for small AI teams | `Benchmark A` and `Benchmark B` are mandatory and must include why they matter to small teams. |
| Repeatable scripts and structured outputs | `Repro Steps` and `Reproducibility Package` must include concrete commands and JSON/CSV/JSONL artifact links. |
| Include visualizations | Each benchmark arc and each high-value supporting section must include at least one linked visual. |
| Provide unique operator insights | `Implications For Small AI Teams` and `Gaps, Risks, and Smell Checks` must include experience-derived insights. |
