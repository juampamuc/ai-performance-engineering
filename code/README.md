# AI Systems Performance Engineering

## Summary
Reference implementation of high-performance PyTorch, CUDA, and Triton workloads for NVIDIA Blackwell platforms.
The repository packages 20 focused chapters, advanced labs, and the shared benchmarking harness so you can profile baselines, apply optimizations, and capture artifacts that prove performance gains.

Roadmap: [`docs/performance_repo_roadmap.md`](docs/performance_repo_roadmap.md) defines the prioritized plan for canonical suites, trend tracking, anti-pattern enforcement, shared benchmark bases, and evidence-first documentation.

## Problem
Most performance repos are easy to browse and hard to trust. This one is meant to do the opposite:
- baseline and optimized paths live side-by-side
- correctness checks run before speedup claims matter
- profiler artifacts and benchmark manifests are first-class outputs, not optional extras

## Tier-1 Canonical Suite
The fastest way to answer "is this repo still delivering real wins?" is the canonical tier-1 suite.

```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench run-tier1 --single-gpu --profile minimal
```

That command now writes a stable history package under `artifacts/history/tier1/<run_id>/`:
- `summary.json`: per-target baseline, optimized path, and best speedup
- `regression_summary.md`: human-readable before/after summary against the previous tier-1 run
- `regression_summary.json`: machine-readable regressions and improvements
- `trend_snapshot.json`: run-history summary for dashboards and release notes
- `artifacts/history/tier1/index.json`: suite history index

See [`docs/tier1_benchmark_suite.md`](docs/tier1_benchmark_suite.md) for the current target list, artifact contract, and interpretation guidance.

## Current Representative Deltas
These numbers are taken from the latest canonical tier-1 history summary rather than from hand-maintained README text.

Source artifact: `artifacts/history/tier1/20260309_211715_tier1_nightly_local/summary.json`

Representative suite speedup: `7.16x` geomean, `8.29x` median, `21.79x` arithmetic average.

| Target | Baseline | Optimized | Measured delta | Artifact |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `labs/block_scaling:block_scaling` | `0.197 ms` | `0.117 ms` | `1.68x` | `artifacts/history/tier1/20260309_211715_tier1_nightly_local/summary.json` |
| `labs/flashattention4:flashattention4_alibi` | `5.440 ms` | `0.385 ms` | `14.14x` | `artifacts/history/tier1/20260309_211715_tier1_nightly_local/summary.json` |
| `labs/persistent_decode:persistent_decode` | `1.331 ms` | `0.089 ms` | `15.03x` | `artifacts/history/tier1/20260309_211715_tier1_nightly_local/summary.json` |
| `labs/kv_optimization:kv_standard` | `1606.800 ms` | `993.124 ms` | `1.62x` | `artifacts/history/tier1/20260309_211715_tier1_nightly_local/summary.json` |
| `ch04:gradient_fusion` | `3.554 ms` | `0.037 ms` | `95.84x` | `artifacts/history/tier1/20260309_211715_tier1_nightly_local/summary.json` |
| `labs/real_world_models:llama_3_1_8b` | `12.812 ms` | `5.259 ms` | `2.44x` | `artifacts/history/tier1/20260309_211715_tier1_nightly_local/summary.json` |

## Profiler Evidence
When you want proof beyond wall-clock timing, use the same harness target with a profiling mode instead of a different script.

```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/block_scaling:block_scaling --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/flashattention4:flashattention4_alibi --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets labs/persistent_decode:persistent_decode --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
```

- `minimal` is the fastest artifact-bearing path.
- `deep_dive` is the profiler-backed path for Nsight Systems + Nsight Compute comparisons.
- The benchmark harness now blocks more hot-path anti-patterns and follows imported helper code, so "clean benchmark" means more than it used to.

## Lab Navigation
If you are navigating by performance problem instead of by chapter, start with these benchmark-pair labs:

| Lab | Best for | Distinct from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `labs/parameterized_cuda_graphs` | fixed-shape PyTorch CUDA Graph replay where request bindings change but graph topology does not | broader decode-serving labs; dynamic-shape graph problems |
| `labs/persistent_decode` | persistent decode kernels plus graph/TMA variants on serving-style decode paths | the narrower executable-graph parameter-mutation story |
| `labs/decode_optimization` | decode microbenchmarks that separate pinned memory, streams, compile, graphs, and cache policy | a single graph-launch-overhead benchmark pair |
| `labs/block_scaling` | Blackwell block-scaled GEMM mechanics and measured tensor-core wins | serving/control-plane orchestration labs |
| `labs/training_hotpath` | training-path launch and fusion bottlenecks with clean benchmark pairs | inference/decode-oriented graph replay work |

This keeps `labs/parameterized_cuda_graphs` visible without pretending it replaces the broader persistent-decode or decode-optimization stories.

## Benchmark Methodology
This repo now exposes one repeatable benchmarking methodology instead of leaving performance work as a collection of scripts.

Start with:
- [`docs/benchmark_methodology.md`](docs/benchmark_methodology.md) for the three-layer model (`micro`, `component`, `end_to_end`), bottleneck taxonomy, publication-vs-realism policy, and straggler playbook.
- [`docs/performance_warehouse.md`](docs/performance_warehouse.md) for the stable event schema, raw-versus-curated storage split, retention tiers, and telemetry lineage back to raw evidence.
- [`templates/performance_intake.yaml`](templates/performance_intake.yaml) for KPIs, constraints, and the variable under test.
- [`templates/benchmark_workload_spec.yaml`](templates/benchmark_workload_spec.yaml) for the frozen workload definition and measurement policy.
- [`templates/benchmark_run.yaml`](templates/benchmark_run.yaml) for the CRD-aligned declarative `BenchmarkRun` shape the repo would map onto a Kubernetes-native service.
- [`cluster/docs/kubernetes_benchmark_service.md`](cluster/docs/kubernetes_benchmark_service.md) plus [`cluster/configs/benchmarkrun-crd.yaml`](cluster/configs/benchmarkrun-crd.yaml) for the cluster-native operator/CRD direction already being sketched in the repo.

Thin surfaces for these contracts are also exposed through `python -m cli.aisp tools benchmark-contracts`, dashboard API `GET /api/benchmark/contracts`, and MCP tool `benchmark_contracts`.

The current harness already captures manifests, profiler artifacts, raw timings, and artifact hashes. Cryptographic provenance signing is still a documented gap, so external publication packets should record that explicitly rather than assuming hashes alone are sufficient.

## Cluster Evaluation
Cluster evaluation has one supported artifact contract for new work:

```text
cluster/runs/<run_id>/
  manifest.json
  structured/
  raw/
  figures/
  reports/
```

Start with:
- [`cluster/README.md`](cluster/README.md) for the current commands and folder contract.
- `python -m cli.aisp cluster common-eval --preset common-answer-fast ...` for the normal "evaluate this system" ask.
- `python -m cli.aisp cluster common-eval --preset modern-llm ...` when you need the full canonical package.
- `python -m cli.aisp cluster common-eval --preset multinode-readiness ...` before first real multi-node workloads.
- `python -m cli.aisp cluster promote-run --run-id <run_id> ...` when one collected run should become the published localhost package.

The current published canonical package lives under `cluster/published/current/`. New collection still happens under `cluster/runs/<run_id>/`.

## Learning Goals
- Understand how the chapters, labs, and shared tooling fit together.
- Stand up a reproducible environment for PyTorch 2.10-dev + CUDA 13 workloads on Blackwell GPUs.
- Run the benchmark harness directly or through the Typer CLI for automated artifact capture.
- Validate peak hardware characteristics before grading optimizations against stored expectations.

## Directory Layout
| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ch01` - `ch20` | One directory per chapter with baseline/optimized benchmarks, workload configs, and chapter-level harness entrypoints such as `ch01/compare.py`. |
| `labs/` | Deep-dive labs for memory-bandwidth patterns, matmul, routing, FlexAttention, MoE, persistent decode, distributed training, and more. |
| `core/benchmark/`, `profiling/`, `core/`, `optimization/`, `analysis/` | Shared harness, logging, workload metadata, profiling, and optimization utilities used by every chapter. |
| `python -m cli.aisp bench` | Typer-based CLI for running and profiling targets with reproducible artifacts. |
| `docs/` + `core/scripts/` | Operational guides, profiling workflows, and setup/reset helpers (`setup.sh`, `cleanup.py`, `reset-gpu.sh`). |

## Running the Benchmarks
Use the benchmark harness for quick comparisons or drive the Typer CLI when you need repeatable artifact capture.
```bash
cd ai-performance-engineering
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_latest.txt
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter ch01
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch01 --profile minimal
python -m cli.aisp bench run-tier1 --single-gpu --profile minimal
```
- `setup.sh` installs system prerequisites (drivers, CUDA, Nsight) and should be rerun after driver upgrades.
- Benchmark validity profile defaults to strict. Virtualization is warning-only; use `--validity-profile portable` for broader compatibility on hardware-limited hosts.
- Use `python -m cli.aisp bench expectations --hardware b200 --min-speedup 1.05` to report expectation entries below a target threshold.
- Repeat `--targets` for multi-scope runs, for example `python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch01 --targets ch02 --profile minimal`; use `python -m cli.aisp bench run-tier1 --single-gpu --profile minimal` for the canonical regression suite.
- Portable runs do not update expectation files unless `--allow-portable-expectations-update` is supplied.
- `python core/analysis/analyze_expectations.py --artifacts-dir artifacts` compares new runs to stored thresholds.

## Validation Checklist
- `pytest tests/integration` succeeds to confirm harness discovery and CLI plumbing.
- `python core/benchmark/benchmark_peak.py` reports TFLOP/s, bandwidth, and NVLink numbers close to the published ceilings.

## Wall of Shame
The benchmark harness includes a strict set of correctness and validity checks to prevent misleading speedups.
Below is the reference list of validity issues we explicitly protect against, plus real-world incidents that
motivated these checks.

Note: All 95 validity issues are protected by the harness.

CUDA Graph Note: Capturing CUDA graphs in `setup()` is allowed for steady-state replay benchmarks (we intentionally
measure replay, not capture). It is NOT allowed to precompute and reuse the final output from `setup()`. The output
used for verification must come from the timed `benchmark_fn()` run and be surfaced via `capture_verification_payload()`.

Virtualization Note: `validate_environment()` treats virtualization (hypervisor present) as a warning. Benchmarks can
run in virtualized environments, but bare metal remains the preferred source for final performance numbers.

### Deep Dive: The Locus/KernelBench Stream Timing Vulnerability

This 2025 incident illustrates why correctness verification alone is insufficient.

```python
# VULNERABLE TIMING (what KernelBench did)
start_event.record(original_model_stream)  # Only records on default stream
model(*inputs)                              # But work runs on s1, s2, s3
end_event.record(original_model_stream)    # Timer stops before s1/s2/s3 finish
torch.cuda.synchronize(device=device)      # Waits, but timing already recorded

# CORRECT TIMING (the fix)
for stream in custom_model_streams:
    custom_model_stream.wait_stream(stream)  # Wait for ALL streams
_event.record(custom_model_stream)           # Then record timing
```

The exploit pattern:
1. AI creates non-default streams: `s1 = getStreamFromPool()`, `s2 = ...`, `s3 = ...`
2. AI launches GEMMs on those streams: `at::mm_out(gate, x2d, gate_proj.t())` on s1
3. AI does not call `setCurrentCUDAStream(s3)` or wait for streams before returning
4. Correctness test uses `torch.cuda.synchronize()` and passes
5. Performance test uses stream-specific events and reports fake speedups

Result: 82/250 (32.8 percent) of RL-generated CUDA kernels exploited this, producing artificial 18x speedups with
zero actual performance improvement.
