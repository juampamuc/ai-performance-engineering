# Chapter 1 - Performance Fundamentals

## Summary
Establishes the baseline benchmarking discipline with a simple training-loop goodput benchmark and a small CUDA GEMM case study. The goal is to ground later optimizations in repeatable measurement, equivalent workloads, and verifiable outputs. The repo chapter intentionally blends the book's introductory methodology material with an early hands-on kernel case study so the harness contract is concrete from the start.

## Problem
Chapter 1 sets the measurement contract for the rest of the repo. The useful question here is not "can I make something faster?" but "can I show a repeatable before/after delta without changing the workload or hiding correctness problems?"

## Baseline Path
- eager FP32 or minimally optimized Python training loops
- one-launch-per-work-item CUDA examples
- benchmark setups that make launch overhead and framework overhead visible

## Optimized Path
- FP16 and fused microbatch execution for the training loop
- separate precision-only and fusion-only variants so the training-loop story is decomposable
- batched or strided CUDA launches to amortize dispatch cost
- memory-reduction variants where the main win is footprint, not raw speed

## Measured Delta
Representative validated results from `artifacts/runs/20260303_163946__bench__profile_minimal_targets_20/`:

| Target | Baseline | Optimized | Measured delta | What changed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `gemm` | `0.364 ms` | `0.012 ms` | `29.51x` | strided batched GEMM removes launch overhead |
| `performance` | `68.836 ms` | `14.286 ms` | `4.82x` | FP16 + fused microbatches raise goodput |
| `nvfp4_mlp` | `1.130 ms` | `1.167 ms` | `0.97x` | near-flat latency, but `37.9%` lower memory use |

This chapter intentionally includes both pure speedup examples and one memory-oriented tradeoff so later chapters do not overfit on "speedup only" thinking.

## Training-Loop Variants
The Chapter 1 training loop is intentionally split into three related targets:

| Target | Isolated change | Intended lesson |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `performance` | FP16 math + fused microbatches | the combined goodput story |
| `performance_fp16` | FP16 math only | what tensor-core-friendly precision buys you without changing batching; uses a more compute-heavy local shape so precision is visible |
| `performance_fusion` | fused microbatches only | what launch amortization buys you without changing math precision |

## Profiler Evidence
Use deep-dive harness runs when you want proof of where the win comes from instead of only a runtime delta:

```bash
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch01:gemm --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch01:performance --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch01:nvfp4_mlp --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
```

The expected profiler story is straightforward:
- `gemm`: fewer launches and lower dispatch overhead
- `performance`: fewer launches plus faster tensor-core math
- `performance_fp16`: faster GEMMs from FP16 tensor-core math with the same microbatch structure, using a benchmark-local compute-heavy shape so the precision delta is not drowned out by Python overhead
- `performance_fusion`: fewer forward/backward launches at unchanged FP32 math
- `nvfp4_mlp`: reduced memory footprint rather than a large wall-clock win

## Repro Commands
```bash
python -m ch01.compare
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter ch01
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch01 --profile minimal
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch01:gemm --profile deep_dive --single-gpu
```

## Learning Goals
- Profile a minimal PyTorch training loop with the shared harness and reason about throughput vs latency.
- Separate precision wins from batching wins instead of treating all training-loop speedups as one bundle.
- Compare hand-written GEMM kernels in batched vs. strided forms to understand arithmetic intensity.

## Directory Layout
| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `baseline_performance.py`, `optimized_performance.py`, `baseline_performance_fp16.py`, `optimized_performance_fp16.py`, `optimized_performance_fusion.py` | Training-loop variants covering the baseline, the combined FP16+fusion path, the FP16-only pair with a benchmark-local compute-heavy shape, and the fusion-only path. |
| `baseline_gemm.cu`, `optimized_gemm_batched.cu`, `optimized_gemm_strided.cu` | CUDA GEMM variants (single, batched, strided) used to illustrate launch amortization and memory coalescing. |
| `compare.py`, `workload_config.py`, `arch_config.py`, `expectations_{hardware_key}.json` | Harness entrypoint, workload shapes, architecture overrides, and stored expectation thresholds. |

## Running the Benchmarks
Use the benchmark harness for quick comparisons or drive the Typer CLI when you need repeatable artifact capture.
```bash
python -m ch01.compare
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter ch01
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch01 --profile minimal
```
- Override `--profile` or `--iterations` per workload when capturing Nsight traces.
- Benchmark validity profile defaults to strict. Virtualization is warning-only; use `--validity-profile portable` for broader compatibility on hardware-limited environments.
- Expectation baselines live next to each chapter in `expectations_{hardware_key}.json`; refresh with `--update-expectations` after validating new hardware. In portable mode, add `--allow-portable-expectations-update` to write expectation files explicitly.

## Validation Checklist
- `python -m ch01.compare` reports the chapter baseline/optimized training loop pair through the shared harness with consistent workloads.
- Running `make && ./baseline_gemm_sm100` vs `./optimized_gemm_batched_sm100` shows a substantial drop in launch count and total runtime.

## Notes
- `requirements.txt` pins lightweight extras (Typer, tabulate) used by helper scripts.
- `Makefile` builds the CUDA GEMM binaries with SM-specific suffixes for quick diffing.
